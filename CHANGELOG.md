## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- "LLVM ERROR: Invalid LLVMRustVisibility value!" with `1.2.1`/[`1d6f2b9`] by
  making the statics `pub`.

[`1d6f2b9`]: https://github.com/nvzqz/embed-plist-rs/commit/1d6f2b997acb9db76062aaae4c55f8c41422660e

## [1.2.1] - 2022-01-09

### Fixed

- Property section was not being emitted due to a change in how `#[used]` works.
  This seems to be caused by [rust#87570], which switches `#[used]` from
  `llvm.used` to `llvm.compiler.used`.

[rust#87570]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87570

## [1.2.0] - 2020-08-30

### Added

- `embed_info_plist_bytes!` macro.

### Added

- `get_info_plist` function to get contents from `embed_info_plist!` macro.

### Changed

  for some reason.
